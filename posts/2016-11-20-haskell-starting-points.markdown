Haskell is a nice language that may seem quite academic at first, and not really
applicable outside of this world, compared to bigger languages such as Java, C#,
Python, and other imperative programming languages.

I picked [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) particularly to have a motivation
for learning it better. Besides, I have been considering to install xmonad to
use as a Window manager.

The web is full of resources for learning functional programming, ranging from
scientific papers on different topics (Functional Pearls are a good starting
point), to beginner's book, as well as open-source projects with a rich bug
tracker to describe details of implementation of a problem.

I stumbled upon a few good podcasts with various themes.

* [Type Theory Cast](...)
* [Haskell Cast](...)

The Haskell Wiki contains many good resouces, but since there is so much
information, maybe a good starting points are worth pointing
out. The [Typeclassopedia]() has helped me, as well as the [Monad Reader]().  To
get inspiration on how to start using
Haskell [Learn you a Haskell](https://www.learnyouahaskell.com) (it's fairly
well-known).

Blogs with interesting topcis are often more helpful and relevant in terms of
showing applications of a particular language technique, a library or how to
solve an algorithmic problem functionally. [Brent Yorgey's blog](...) contains
many interesting things. [Haskell Weekly](...) finds different blog posts from
week and aggregates them in a newsletter.

The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is open-source, and well-documented. An outline of
its internals and architecture is described in [a chapter](...) in
the [Architeture of Open-Source Application book](http://aosabook.org). The
history of the language also gives a very insight in Haskell and its designs,
novel ideas.
