# Weblingo

I have thought it was needed to configure a blog to write about things that I
like and do.  Primarily movies, technology and linguistics.

[Haskell](http://haskell.org) is a nice language that mainly receives attention
in academic circles.  I have long wanted to learn it, which is best done in a
practical aspect.  Most of the code for this was taken from various sources, and
combined into a single static site.

Written in [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) as I wanted something simple,
rather than using a CMS, such as WordPress or a tool
based on [Django](https://djangoproject.org).
